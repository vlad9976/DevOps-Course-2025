# 🌍 AWS Regions and Availability Zones

This section explains the core geographic infrastructure of AWS — **Regions** and **Availability Zones (AZs)** — essential for designing scalable, fault-tolerant, and resilient cloud applications.

## 📍 What is an AWS Region?

An **AWS Region** is a **geographic area** containing multiple **Availability Zones**.

### ✅ Key Points:
- Each region is **isolated** and **independent**.
- Regions allow you to deploy resources closer to your customers.
- Examples: `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`, `ap-south-1`

### 🌎 Examples of Regions:
| Region Name     | Region Code  | Location            |
|------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| US East (N. Virginia) | `us-east-1` | North America       |
| US West (Oregon)     | `us-west-2` | North America       |
| Europe (Ireland)     | `eu-west-1` | Europe              |
| Asia Pacific (Mumbai)| `ap-south-1`| India               |

## 🧱 What is an Availability Zone (AZ)?

An **Availability Zone** is a **physically isolated data center** within a region.

### ✅ Key Points:
- Each region has **2 or more AZs** (some have up to 6).
- AZs are isolated but connected via **low-latency links**.
- Designed for **fault tolerance** — if one AZ goes down, others continue running.

### 🧠 Use Case:
To build high availability into your application, you can deploy **multiple EC2 instances** across **different AZs** in the same region.

## 🌐 Region vs AZ Summary

| Feature            | Region                       | Availability Zone          |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Scope              | Geographic area               | Data center within region   |
| Isolation          | Complete region-level         | Partial, within region      |
| Purpose            | User location optimization    | Fault-tolerance and HA      |
| Example            | `us-east-1`                   | `us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b`  |

## 📦 AWS CLI: Get Regions & AZs

```bash
# List all AWS regions
aws ec2 describe-regions --query "Regions[*].RegionName"

# List AZs in a region
aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --region us-east-1 --query "AvailabilityZones[*].ZoneName"
```

---

## 🛠 Best Practices

- Deploy across **multiple AZs** for fault tolerance
- Choose the **closest region** for performance and compliance
- Understand service availability per region (not all services are in every region)
- Use **auto scaling** and **load balancers** across AZs
