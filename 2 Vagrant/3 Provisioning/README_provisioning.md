## ðŸ“‚ Provisioning Script Actions

The embedded shell script executes on `vagrant up` and performs the following actions:

```bash
yum install httpd wget unzip git -y      # Install essential packages
mkdir /opt/devops                        # Create directory
touch /opt/devops/stats                  # Create a log file
```

It then logs the following system information into `/opt/devops/stats`:
- Current date and time
- System uptime
- Current user (`whoami`)
- Available memory (`free -m`)
- Disk usage (`df -h`)

The script also echoes the contents of the file back to the terminal for verification.

## ðŸš¦ Usage

```bash
vagrant up            # Boot and provision the VM
vagrant ssh           # Connect to the machine
cat /opt/devops/stats # View system stats after provisioning
vagrant halt          # Stop the machine
vagrant destroy       # Remove the machine
```
