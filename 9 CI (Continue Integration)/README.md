# 🔁 Continuous Integration (CI) - README

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and validated every time developers push code to version control. CI helps to detect issues early and ensures code stability.

---

## 🎯 Objective of CI

- Detect integration issues early
- Maintain a consistently working build
- Enable automated testing
- Reduce integration and release efforts
- Foster team collaboration

---

## 🔄 CI Pipeline Flow

```
Code Commit → Automated Build → Test → Code Analysis → Package → Artifact Upload → Notification
```

## 🛠 Common CI Tools

| Tool       | Description                          |
|------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Jenkins**| Open-source automation server        |
| GitHub Actions | CI/CD integrated with GitHub    |
| GitLab CI  | Integrated into GitLab platform      |
| CircleCI   | Cloud-native, container-focused CI   |
| Travis CI  | Lightweight CI for GitHub projects   |
| TeamCity   | JetBrains CI/CD server               |
| Bamboo     | Atlassian CI server                  |

---

## 🧰 Typical CI Setup

1. **Source Control**: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
2. **CI Tool**: Jenkins / GitHub Actions
3. **Build Tool**: Maven / Gradle / NPM / MSBuild
4. **Test Framework**: JUnit, TestNG, Mocha, etc.
5. **Artifact Storage**: S3, Nexus, Artifactory
6. **Notifications**: Slack, Email, Webhook

## 📦 CI with Maven Project (Jenkins Example)

### 🧪 Jenkins Pipeline Example

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any

  tools {
    maven 'Maven-3.8.5' // Defined in Jenkins Tools Config
  }

  stages {
    stage('Checkout') {
      steps {
        git 'https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git'
      }
    }
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        sh 'mvn clean install'
      }
    }
    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        sh 'mvn test'
      }
    }
    stage('Archive') {
      steps {
        archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'target/*.war', fingerprint: true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## ✅ Benefits of CI

- Faster feedback on broken builds
- Higher software quality
- Shorter release cycles
- Reduced integration issues
- Enables Continuous Delivery (CD)

---

## 📚 Best Practices

- Commit small and often
- Use feature branches + Pull Requests
- Run unit tests and integration tests
- Keep builds fast and isolated
- Automate code linting and static analysis
- Enforce pipeline checks before merges
